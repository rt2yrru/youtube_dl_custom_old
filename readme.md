Improved and structured code @

https://github.com/siddht4/youtube-dl-embed



rejoice :
Multi processing enabled :

#1 Added a test even-odd list structure where a giant list is split into two smaller list based on even -odd position.
Number of parallel pools are 2.

#2 Spliting list into 4 smaller list. using algorithm k%4 where k is the position aka counter. 
      
      So if k%4==0, then append it into list_4
          else  if  aka elif  k%4==1,then append it into list_1 
          
          and so on
